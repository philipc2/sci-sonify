# Turning Scientific Data into Sounds & Music

## What is it?

Sci-Sonify is a Python package that enables simple and straightforward data sonification (a.k.a. representing data as sounds). It represents data from common packages in the Scientific Python Ecosystem such as Numpy, Pandas, and Xarray as musical notes.

## Soundmaps
Instead of using colors (i.e. colormaps) for visualuzing data, Sci-Sonify introduces the concept of "soundmaps", which allow for mapping quantitative data to a range of musical notes.

TODO: add a visual comparing "colormaps" to "soundmaps"

## Accessors
TODO: describe the xarray, pandas, accessors to enable sonification
