# Turning Scientific Data into Sounds & Music

## What is it?

Sci-Sonify is a Python package that enables simple and straightforward data sonification (turning data into sounds). It converts data represented using common packages from the Scientiffic Python Ecosystem such as Numpy, Pandas, and Xarray into sounds and music.

## Soundmaps
Instead of using colors (i.e. colormaps) for visualuzing data, Sci-Sonify introduces the concept of "soundmaps", which allow for mapping quantitative data to a range of musical notes.

TODO: add a visual comparing "colormaps" to "soundmaps"

## Accessors
TODO: describe the xarray, pandas, accessors to enable sonification
